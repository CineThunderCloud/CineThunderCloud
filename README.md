# CineThunderCloud
CineThunderCloud is an open-source project that integrates an LED cloud ceiling with Govee LED strips into home theaters. Using a Raspberry Pi and audio analysis, thunder and rain scenes in movies are detected, and the cloud ceiling is synchronized accordingly. An immersive experience for your home theater.
