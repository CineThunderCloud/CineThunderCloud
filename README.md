# CineThunderCloud
CineThunderCloud is an open-source project designed for home theater enthusiasts who want to take their cinematic experience to the next level. Using a Raspberry Pi and a microphone, the software analyzes audio signals through machine learning to detect thunder and rain scenes in movies. It learns by training on thunder and rain sounds, and once detected, it synchronizes the Govee LED strips via the Govee API to create an immersive and dynamic atmosphere in your home theater.
