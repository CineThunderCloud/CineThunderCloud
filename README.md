# CineThunderCloud

**CineThunderCloud** is an open-source project designed for home theater enthusiasts who want to take their cinematic experience to the next level. Using a Raspberry Pi and a microphone, the software analyzes audio signals through machine learning to detect thunder and rain scenes in movies. It learns by training on thunder and rain sounds, and once detected, it synchronizes the Govee LED strips via the Govee API to create an immersive and dynamic atmosphere in your home theater.

## About Me

I'm not a professional programmer, but I am passionate about creating this project. While I am unable to handle the programming tasks myself, I am actively involved in other aspects such as training the machine learning model with thunder and rain sounds, as well as building and testing the prototype setup.

If you're a developer or machine learning enthusiast, your help with coding would be greatly appreciated. I can support with testing, data collection, and providing feedback on the setup!


## About the Project

This project aims to create an interactive LED cloud ceiling that synchronizes with thunder and rain sounds from movies, enhancing the home theater experience. The goal is to use machine learning to detect these sound patterns and trigger Govee LED strips accordingly.
